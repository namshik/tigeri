## Introduction ##

TIGERi is a computational method to model and visualize the response of an inferred TF network to perturbation. The method was tested using publicly available data from which compares gene expression profiles of a mouse p38α knock-out line to the original wild-type. From these results TIGERi has produced a model for the TF regulatory network which responds to the presence or absence of p38α. A part of this network was confirmed in the original paper. TIGERi also identified additional relationships, which although not explored in the original analysis, are strongly supported in the literature. The paper is describing a use case of a method that other groups can use. By using this systematic method, wet-lab scientists could be able to analyze their own datasets to identify novel findings so that they can generate a testable hypothesis for further in vivo experiments.
